# Simple-Chat-App
This is a simple real-time chat app created with Node.js and socket.io. For this to run on localhost, I have used live server extension in VS code, but alternatively you can setup a node server as well. Nodemon was also used to reload server automatically.

Will update styling and will be adding new feature at a later time
